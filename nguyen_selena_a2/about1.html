        <p>I am 19 years old, going on 20 this year. My birthday is May 24, making me a Gemini, and I'm born the Lunar year of the rabbit – that is, 1999. I was born and raised in Mississauga, Ontario, but I am of Chinese and Vietnamese descent. My parents both came to Canada in their teens as refugees, and have lived here since. My family consists of my parents, me, and my sister, as well as many many many aunts, uncles, and cousins.</p>

        <p> I am currently enrolled in Global Business and Digital Arts at the University of Waterloo. I chose this program because I wanted to pursue business, but when I was in high school, I was in a regional arts program for visual arts. I wanted to be able to go into a post-secondary program where I was still able to do visual arts, but not a fully arts-focused program. This program allowed me the best of both worlds.</p>
