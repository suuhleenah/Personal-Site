        <p>Travelling has always been a big part of my life. I have been lucky enough to be able to travel somewhere every year of my life, although most of the time to the same places. Nevertheless, I appreciate every second I spend away from home. I love experiencing other cultures and seeing how different communities are like. So far, I've been to places in the USA, Domincan Republic, Cuba, other parts of Canada, China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, England, France, Prague, and Hungary.

        <p>I'm a foodie, so one of my favourite parts about being abroad is all of the food I get to try. Local foods could never compare to having it back at home. I love being able to try different foods in different places – it's interesting how things differ based on where you are.

        <p>One of the most beautiful places I've been to is Budapest, the capital of Hungary. The trip was incredible – I was lucky enough to be able to have dinner on a boat and be able to see all the beautiful sites in the area. It was so interesting to be able to study the architectural details of the city in person. Pictures could never compare, but I've attached pictures, anyway.
